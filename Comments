Hi Leonard,

your website is well-structured and visually appealing. Your use of semantic HTML elements and class names are effective in conveying the meaning and purpose of different sections of your web page. I think here are some ways to improve the quality even further:
- Don't forget to include alt and aria tag attributes for images and links
- It's a good practice to include a meta description on your web pages. This can help improve your search engine ranking and make it easier for users to find your website.
- You may want to consider using a code formatter tool or VS Code extensions to help you automatically format your code with the corresponding indentation and remove any extra white spaces.

Keep it up :)
