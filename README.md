I followed the tutorial and ran into many issues. I was trying to adapt what I've learned to my project but for right now, it would be very great to get some more feedback for the current state of the project and the bugs.

The ultimate game to get your new flat registered
This site will be a fun little game. I moved a few days ago and had to register my new residence. I was very amused by the bad site where I had to find out, that firstly, I have to bring a copy of the registration to the citizen's office in person. And secondly, that there is not a single free slot in the next 4 month as well as no waitlist.
Luckily, someone told me that new slots are added at 8am every day. But to be prepared catching a slot before others do, I had to train. This is what this project is for:
Later, the current calendar in the level Berlin will later be advanced with the JavaScript functionality of a "beat the mole" game. The days will turn green for a very short amount of time, and when you catch a green one, you win.
The level "Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg" is just a button to for online residence registration to show the contrasts. Another idea is to rebuild the design of different citizen office websites because it's a great thing for practice, but also to show how bad and inconsistent the different designs are.

This project could include many more funny mini-games, for example a replica of the "einmalzahlung200" form that's exaggeratedly broken.
The neobrutalistic pastel retro look is an allusion to the outdated civic offices. The site is inspired by a Webflow site I've recently built using a template: https://www.homewizards.de/
The site itself is in German, because I want to share the game with a German-speaking audience.
